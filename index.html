    <br>
    <div> Hello! Welcome to my humble portfolio for EECS 494: Intro to Game Development!</div>
    <br>
    <div class="important">P1: Zelda</div>
    <div>Below you can see the group effort that Ryan Duan and I put to create a replica of the classic Legend of Zelda game for the NES!</div>
    <br>
    <p><b>MY CONTRIBUTIONS:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Handled room transitions: Moving from room to room, disabling enemy movement in between rooms, creating locked doors, etc.</li>
      <li>Created the Boomerang weapon: Coded the behavorial script, handled its interactions with other objects, dealt with enemy stun, and more.</li>
      <li>Created the Sprites for the new mechanic: I love drawing! Drew new sprites, such as a portal gun, orange/blue portals, and new projectiles.</li>
      <li>Created most collectables: Implemented mob drops like hearts, rupees, keys, bombs, and special ones like heart containers and the boomerang.</li>
      <li>Implemented most of the sound effects: Different pick-up sounds, attacking with a weapon, bomb explosion, enemy death, and more.</li>
      <li>To just name a few :D!</li>
    </ul>

    <b>TECHNOLOGY USED:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Coding Language: C# as done in Unity</li>
      <li>Game Engine: Unity v.2022.3.43</li>
      <li>Drawing Program to make sprites: Krita</li>
      <li>Code Editor: Visual Studio Community 2019</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <div class="important">P2: Ice Cube Crawl</div>
    <div>Here is my creation for project 2! I was inspired by games like N-Step Steve and Can of Wormholes to make a movement based puzzle game.</div>
    <div>I wanted the mechanics to be simple to grasp without need for instructions yet complex when they all work together.</div>
    <br>
    <p><b>MY CONTRIBUTIONS:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hand drew all the sprites + art used in the game using Krita.</li>
      <li>Designed and implemented all the code using the EventBus architecture and other techniques.</li>
      <li>Searched for fitting audio to use for all the soundeffects off of freesound.org (I did not create any sounds)</li>
      <li>Designed all the levels used in the game with player growth in mind, so that players would learn mechanics on their own.</li>
    </ul>
