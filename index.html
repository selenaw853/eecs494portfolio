      <li>Handled room transitions: Moving from room to room, disabling enemy movement in between rooms, creating locked doors, etc.</li>
      <li>Created the Boomerang weapon: Coded the behavorial script, handled its interactions with other objects, dealt with enemy stun, and more.</li>
      <li>Created the Sprites for the new mechanic: I love drawing! Drew new sprites, such as a portal gun, orange/blue portals, and new projectiles.</li>
      <li>Created most collectables: Implemented mob drops like hearts, rupees, keys, bombs, and special ones like heart containers and the boomerang.</li>
      <li>Implemented most of the sound effects: Different pick-up sounds, attacking with a weapon, bomb explosion, enemy death, and more.</li>

    <div class="important">P2: Ice Cube Crawl</div>
    <div>Here is my creation for project 2! I was inspired by games like N-Step Steve and Can of Wormholes to make a movement based puzzle game.</div>
    <div>I wanted the mechanics to be simple to grasp without need for instructions yet complex when they all work together.</div>
